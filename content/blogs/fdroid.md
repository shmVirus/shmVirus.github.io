Many of us faced different errors regrading Play Store over the time. Some of us thinks how can we get rid of Play Store, as it takes too much resources! I'm here to solve your these issue.

We will use two apps to replace Play Store, don't worry both of them takes less resources compared to Play Store. These apps are:
F-droid: Limited apps compared to Play Store, but lightweight and Free and Open Source apps
Aurora Store: Like as Play Store, but without sign-in, have more features than Play Store [available in F-droid]

F-droid can be downloaded from here (https://f-droid.org/F-Droid.apk), now install F-droid. Now download and install Aurora Store (https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.aurora.store/) from F-droid. If you have root permission, you can also install F-droid Privileged Extension (https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged/) from F-droid; it installs apps in background. If you don't have root permission, you don't have to install this. This is not a must have application, but nice to have if you have root permissions. That's it, now just disable Play Store and enjoy service of F-droid and Aurora Store.

TIP#1: If you need any app, try to find it on F-droid. If the app is not available on F-droid, try to find a alternative of that application from this AlternativeTo (http://alternativeto.net/) site. Use Open Source and Android filter while searching. If you  find any similar app that can do the job then just download it from F-droid. However, if you don't find any, you may install it from Aurora Store.

FunFact#1: Some paid apps from Play Store/Aurora Store can be found free (ðŸ˜‚)  in F-droid. For example just search for Termux plugins in both F-droid and Play Store.
